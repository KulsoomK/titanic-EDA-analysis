# 🛳️ Titanic Data Analysis

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns related to passenger survival. We clean the data, explore it through visualizations, and study key relationships between features like age, fare, class, and family presence. The insights lay the foundation for future machine learning models.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Clean and prepare the Titanic dataset for analysis.
- Visualize and summarize demographic and survival trends.
- Analyze correlations between passenger features.
- Prepare groundwork for predictive modeling.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

## 📊 Key Analyses

- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`, and dropped `Cabin`.
- **Passenger Demographics:** Gender distribution, age spread, family status.
- **Survival Insights:** Survival rates by gender, class, age, and fare.
- **Feature Correlation:** Correlation coefficients.
